1) Is there a reference dot on your IMU?  
ANSWER: YES, bottom right corner.

2) Your header labels are copied and mirrored on top of each other. 
REASON: This is because the reference labels are on different layers.  One is on the top layer, as apposed to the other on the bottom layer.

3) Your voltage regulator is not over the 3v3 power plane. ??
Fix: good catch.  We changed the 3v3 pour perimeter to include the voiltage regulator. 

4) There's a couple overlap/clearance errors on wires near your screw terminal
REASON: Those clearance & overlap errors (net bridge, antenna) have been ok-ed by the professor.  It is because the SMD pads are close together.

5) You have long, thick wires of VBAT connecting to the motor drivers - should
   try to use vias to connect to the VBAT power plane instead  
FIX: BIGGEST CHANGE IN DESIGN. we went through and put via's everywhere a VBAT or BAT_GND line was longer than a few mm's.  Significant trace change.

6) The pours near the antenna / balun / capacitors should ~maybe~ not extend
   underneath that grouping
REASON:  After analyzing the diagram provided in the Lab 5 instructions, it appears that the pours being referred to do go above the grouping (how we have it).  

7) IMU is not aligned to the IMU breakout board.  breakout header J2 should be
   moved right a little and the IMU should be rotated 90 degrees to the right ?
Reason: After reanalyzing it, we have concluded that our original design is ok. We did however move the bootloader header down.

8) Crystal is not the same orientation as the FCB or example in class (maybe ok)
FIX:  This is actually a great catch. We actually ended up changing a ton of the positioning for the area around the crystal.  The capacitors were in turn pulled closer. So overall it is a better layout in that area now.

9) C7 next to IMU is connected with a via.  I think the capacitors arounf the MCU should be connected directly to the MCU (all traces for caps shoul lie in layer top)
FIX: moved the C7 capacitor to the top left which in turn moved a few other things around.

10) reorient capacitors around MCU to be closer to 3v3 and gnd on all sides of the MCU
FIX: moved C7, R13, C2, C5, and C8 closer to the MCU.

11) check if motor pad pin connect to drain of mosfet needs to be hihg current netclass or default (its not connected to vbat or bat_gnd)
REASON:  Per instructions: "You can skip the signals through the pull-up resistor, if you want".  Which is the "motor pad pin" you're referring to. 

12) You have two overlapping pin names for jumper J4. Delete one of them.
REASON: This is because the reference labels are on different layers.  One is on the top layer, as apposed to the other on the bottom layer.

13) consider keeping LED name format consitent (all uppercase GREEN and BLUE for example)
FIX: The only lowercase name was "green" so I changed that to all uppercase letters.

14) consider keeping consistent format for names and values of parts (e.g. values go on side, names go on top/bottom)
REASON: for the most part, everything is formatted as:
	name of device is to the bottom left, read horizontally 
	value to the middle right, read vertically
	The only exceptions are where this format is not possible (no space to the right, etc.--mainly for the antenna capacitors)

custom

1) LED device - pins are named incorrectly (cathode named A and anode named C)
Reason: The pins are actually named correctly. The symbol is just so short that they appear swapped. Cannot extend the symbol else Eaglint will complain.

LED - 0805_LED

1) datasheet recommends 1.25 x 1.1, you have 1.2 by 1.25
Noted. This is consistent with all of our other 0805 pads.


2) currently your led indicator dot is on the anode, i think polarity mark on
   the part is on the cathode (See datasheets to confirm)
FIX: changed all the LEDS so that the marker is on the cathode side now. How it should be.
